# Image-Based-Feature-Extraction-for-Amazon-Product-Entities

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning solution that extracts key product details, such as weight, dimensions, and volume, directly from images. This capability can be highly useful in various industries like e-commerce, healthcare, and manufacturing, where product information is critical but often unavailable in text form. The model identifies and outputs values such as dimensions (height, width, depth), weight, and other vital characteristics of the product, which can streamline cataloging and inventory processes.

Problem Statement
Many digital stores or platforms do not provide detailed product descriptions, and this project tackles that problem by extracting essential product attributes from images. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict these values from product images and output them in the correct format.

Project Workflow
Data Collection: Download product images using the image URLs provided in the dataset.
Feature Extraction: Train the model to identify and extract values for product entities (like weight, dimensions, etc.) from the images.
Modeling: Develop a model that can process the images, extract the necessary features, and output the predicted values.
Prediction Output: The final output should be in the format “x unit” where x is a numeric value and unit is one of the predefined allowed units.
Dataset
The dataset consists of product images and their corresponding details, with columns such as:

image_link: URL to the product image.
group_id: Product category.
entity_name: The type of attribute to be extracted (e.g., weight, height).
entity_value: The actual value of the entity (for training data).
For test data, the entity_value column is missing and needs to be predicted.

Dataset Files:
train.csv: Training data with entity_value labels.
test.csv: Test data without labels for which predictions need to be made.
Evaluation Criteria
The model will be evaluated based on the accuracy of the predicted product entity values using the F1 Score. Predictions must match the expected format, and invalid formats will lead to evaluation failure.

Solution Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Download images from the URLs provided.
Resize and normalize the images for model compatibility.
Model Architecture:

A deep learning model (such as ResNet) to analyze and extract features from the product images.
The model will be trained to predict the corresponding product entity values.
Training:

Train the model using labeled images in train.csv.
Fine-tune the model to improve the accuracy of predictions.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict the entity values for the test data.
Format the output predictions as “x unit” and ensure the correct formatting for evaluation.
